# How to Display Promotional Messages in the User Dashboard

## Overview

As an admin, you can create and manage promotional messages that will be displayed on user dashboards. This feature enables you to effectively communicate special offers, updates, or important announcements directly to your users, keeping them informed and engaged with your platform. The messages you submit will be visible under the "One-Time" and "Subscription" tabs in the user dashboard, ensuring they reach the intended audience promptly.

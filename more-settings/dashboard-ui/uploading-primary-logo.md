3. Enter the primary logo URL&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This step is required only for those who want to white-label the primary logo URL. This logo URL will be displayed on the user dashboard, replacing the current logo.

Or else you can keep this space empty to have your current logo with the default URL.

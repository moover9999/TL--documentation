# ðŸ’± Crypto Payments

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide will lead you through the process of establishing cryptocurrency payments.&#x20;

_Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that utilizes cryptography for secure financial transactions and operates independently of a central bank._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not endorse platforms like Binance, Coinbase, OKX, or Bybit for exchanges. Our support is solely directed towards crypto wallets like MetaMask. If you lack a crypto wallet, you may obtain one by downloading a wallet extension from Google Chrome. Following this, you can transfer crypto from Binance to your wallet. Numerous options are at your disposal.

To receive payments, individuals must include their EVM wallet address, which remains consistent across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon networks.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
we support Ethereum (ETH) , Polygon (POL) and BNB Smart Chain, along with a variety of tokens to cater to your preferences.&#x20;

You can now utilize the following tokens for seamless transactions:

Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)&#x20;

USD Coin (USDC)&#x20;

Dai (DAI)&#x20;

Tether (USDT)&#x20;

Polygon (MATIC)&#x20;

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)&#x20;

But that's not all! We're dedicated to expanding our support even further.

# How to Update User's Wallet

### **Overview**

We’ve launched a new top-up system to make managing your payments easier. With this system, user can add credits to their account, giving them more flexibility with their payments. Users can easily check their wallet balance and review their credit history right from their dashboard. Admins have their own special dashboard where they can manage user credits, making it simple to oversee all accounts. Additionally, the system supports using the user’s wallet balance for both one-time and recurring payments. This new system is designed to give the user more control and convenience when handling their payments.

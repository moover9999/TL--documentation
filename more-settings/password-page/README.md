# ðŸ”“ Password page

{% hint style="success" %}
When using a password, everyone must enter a password. Even members with a data plan. To help these people who already have a plan, we recommend using the Limited Passwords and making them a special code. Passwords are good if you want to do a group buy and want to keep your proxies exclusive.

# â™£ Sub Admin Users

{% hint style="info" %}
This section will guide you to create sub-admin users by assigning different role permissions. Therefore, this function would allow delegating authority in administrating the dashboard. Furthermore, this will provide restricted access to the sub-users as you have the ability to define the roles. Also, multiple roles could be assigned to an individual role.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be noted that you have to share newly created credentials with new sub-users as the sub-admin users will not get any email notification regarding the assigned roles/permission.

# â™£ Sub Admin Users

{% hint style="info" %}
This section will guide you to create sub admin users by assigning different role permissions. Therefore, this function would allow delegating authority in administrating the dashboard. Furthermore, this will provide restricted access to the sub-users as you have the ability to define the roles. Also, multiple roles could be assigned to an individual role.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be noted that you have to share newly created credentials with new sub-users as the sub-admin users will not get any email notification regarding the assigned roles / permission.

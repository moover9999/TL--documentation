# ã€½ White labeling proxies with your domain



{% hint style="info" %}
This process allows you to brand the proxies with your company name. For example, if you are using packet stream the default proxies will have [packetstream.io](http://packetstream.io) in the name. However, using the following guide you can use your domain instead to brand the proxies.

#### Quick Domain Links

{% hint style="info" %}
Please make sure to have two different names for the default and EU products (i.e. Oxylabs , Smart) when entering to DNS settings. Having the same name for the different products may lead to generating non-functioning proxies.&#x20;

# ðŸ—‘ Deleting an entire product

1. To remove a product, you must archive all the prices associated with the target product following the below guide.

{% content-ref url="deleting-a-product-price.md" %}
[deleting-a-product-price.md](deleting-a-product-price.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2\. Once all the prices are archived, you can archive the whole product in Stripe.

3\. Once the product is archived in Stripe, you will need to re-sync the desired product in our Admin Dashboard.

# üëë Best Practices in Selling Residential Subscriptions

## Overview

Torch Labs offers two flexible Residential Proxy Plans to suit various user needs.

1. **One-Time Purchase**
2. **Subscription**

This highlights the **Subscription Plans**, designed for users who prefer convenience and continuity. With a subscription, users receive a consistent amount of data every cycle, ensuring uninterrupted service without the hassle of manually purchasing new packages.

The subscription model not only provides ease for users but also secures a reliable, recurring income stream for you. By promoting subscription plans, you build customer loyalty while benefiting from predictable monthly revenue‚Äîmaking it a win-win solution for both users and providers.



## Best Practices you can follow

Implementing best practices in your **Residential Subscription Model** ensures a smooth, reliable experience for users while maximizing retention and revenue. Here are some practices we can suggest to you.

### 1. Promote the product

Promoting your product consistently is key to driving user engagement and boosting subscriptions. When marketing your service, emphasize the **advantages of the Subscription Model** over the One-Time Purchase option to attract long-term customers. Here‚Äôs how you can do it effectively:

* **Highlight Convenience**: Emphasize the hassle-free nature of the subscription model. Users don‚Äôt have to manually repurchase. They receive automatic renewals, ensuring continuous access to the service without interruption.
* **Focus on Cost Savings**: Show potential users how subscriptions can offer better value over time. A monthly or annual plan can often be more cost-effective than repeated one-time purchases.
* **Showcase Predictability**: Stress the predictability of both service and cost. Users know exactly what they‚Äôre getting and when; allowing for better budget management.
* **Use Testimonials and Case Studies**: Highlight real-life examples or success stories where users have benefitted from the subscription model. This can help build trust and convince potential customers of the model's advantages.
* **Cross-Sell and Upsell**: During promotions, suggest upgrading to a subscription when users are considering one-time purchases, pointing out long-term benefits.

By continually promoting the **Subscription Model** and demonstrating its advantages, you not only increase signups but also build a loyal, recurring customer base.



### 2. Provide Offers and Discounts

Introducing special Offers and Discounts is a proven strategy to attract customers and encourage them to choose the **Subscription Model** over one-time purchases. Here‚Äôs how you can use offers effectively to drive more subscriptions:

* **Offer Subscription-Exclusive Discounts**:
  * Promote the **Subscription Model** by setting the price lower than the one-time purchase option. This makes the subscription appear more valuable, as customers see they can save money in the long run.
  * Example: ‚ÄúSave 20% on your first 3 months when you subscribe today!‚Äù
* **Use Time-Limited Offers**:
  * Create a sense of urgency by offering **limited-time discounts**. For instance, you can run promotions where users can subscribe at a reduced price if they sign up within a specific period.
  * Example: ‚ÄúSubscribe before this weekend and get 30% off your first 3 months!‚Äù
* **Provide Coupon Codes for Subscriptions**:
  * Issue **coupon codes** exclusively for subscription plans. This not only motivates users to choose subscriptions but also makes the offer feel more personalized. You can create coupon codes by using [this guide](https://docs.torchlabs.xyz/product-settings/coupons).
  * Example: ‚ÄúUse code SUBSCRIBE10 at checkout to get 10% off your subscription!‚Äù

By incorporating well-structured **discounts and offers**, you can make the Subscription Model more attractive and encourage users to commit to longer-term plans. These strategies not only drive higher conversion rates but also build a stronger, loyal customer base that provides steady, recurring revenue.



### 3. Introduce Referral System

A **Referral System** is a powerful tool to grow your subscription base by leveraging your existing customers. By rewarding current subscribers for bringing in new users, you not only increase your reach but also strengthen customer loyalty.&#x20;

* **Define the Referral Reward Structure**:
  * Offer **points** or **credits** to existing users each time they successfully refer a new subscriber. These points can accumulate and be used towards future purchases. You can implement a Referral System by using [this guide](https://docs.torchlabs.xyz/customer-dashboard/referral-system).
  * Example: "Earn 100 points for every successful referral. Redeem points for another product!"

By introducing a **Referral System** for subscription users, you create a win-win situation where your existing customers feel appreciated, while your business benefits from increased sign-ups. A well-designed referral program not only grows your user base but also strengthens loyalty by rewarding subscribers for advocating your services.

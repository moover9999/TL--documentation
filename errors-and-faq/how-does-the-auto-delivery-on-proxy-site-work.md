# ‚ùî How does the auto delivery on proxy site work?

Once you have the ISPs you just upload them to the dashboard. For example, if you are doing automatic fulfillment you would ideally know your customers and how much demand you have. So let's say you want to restock 1000 ISPs, you load 1000 in auto mode and just forget about it. As orders come in from customers, they can buy the product as long as it is not OOS (the list you uploaded is not over). If you don't know the demand and you like to sort of do a preorder method then we recommend using our manual mode. In the manual, you would take pre-orders for a few days and close the product by making it OOS, and once you buy the product from the supplier you can fulfill all the orders that you received during the pre-order period. The benefit of this is you get cash upfront from your customers before you pay your supplier.

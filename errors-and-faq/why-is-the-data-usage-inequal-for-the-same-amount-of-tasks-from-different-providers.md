# ‚ùî Why is the data usage inequal for the same amount of tasks from different providers ?

* There could be a variety of reasons why the actual request may differ on each request that a bot sends. The way Oxylabs and other providers operate is that we do not have direct access to the proxies, and there is nothing in the middle as the usage is directly from Oxylabs API, not from our API. For example, the data on your account will call Oxylabs API directly every time you access the dashboard and click on "View Usage" to display the data usage.
* It is similar to when you test 10 proxies once, and then test the same proxies right after that - the speed of the same proxies may differ due to various factors.

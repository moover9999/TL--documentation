# ‚ùî Why is the required region not indicating on the proxies generated by some providers ?

The way it works is that there is a main server that accepts the requests coming to the proxies first. This server then routes the traffic to the proxies in the correct region. Like most people who have a plan with bright, they set up their servers in the US to accept the initial traffic. Some bots/proxy testers will show that the proxies are pinning in the US no matter what region they generate because they are just pining the proxies and not actually creating a request using the proxies. In reality the actually proxy is going to be the correct region. So it will still work during geo locking and all during drops.

Anyway the proxies actually work regardless of what any tester says the region is.

To test accurately to see which country the proxy is pinging from, please login to chrome using the proxy by following this guide: [![](https://oxylabs.io/favicon.ico)How to Use Chrome Browser Proxy Settings](https://oxylabs.io/blog/how-to-set-up-a-chrome-proxy)

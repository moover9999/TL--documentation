# ‚ùî Can the users use the data after the cancellation of the dashboard ?

The customers can use the dashboard until the subscription is ended. So if they cancel and they have more days left before the next billing cycle, the dashboard will be online till then. The proxies will only be accessible during this time. If the customer wants their users to still be able to use their proxies, they should continue for an extra month with the subscription so their users can finish their proxy data.

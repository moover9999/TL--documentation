# ‚ùî Can the orders be deleted from the dashboard?

Unfortunately, there's no way to delete the previous orders from the dashboard. But you can edit the order and manually remove it if you want but ideally should get the provider to disable the proxies.

Please find the following options you have for editing/deleting.

1. Customers can't delete or edit residential orders
2. Customers can edit datacenter orders  if that order is not ISP API(Custom proxies, Porter proxies and TL ISP API)
3. Customers can edit accounts orders
4. Customers can delete manual orders that are not fulfilled in datacenter and account section

Refer to the following guide if you want to edit a transaction and add/remove proxies.

# ‚ùî Can the orders be deleted from the dashboard?

Unfortunately, there's no way to delete the previous orders from the dashboard. But you can edit the order and manually remove it if you want but ideally should get the provider to disable the proxies.

Refer to the following guide if you want to edit a transaction and add/remove proxies.

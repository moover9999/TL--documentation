# ‚ùî How does ISP expiration date work if ISPs are ordered directly?

In terms of expiration, if you buy monthly ISPs from us they last 30 days. So from the moment we deliver them to you in the ticket that's when the clock starts. So you should deliver them to your customers the same day we deliver to you so the customers will also still get 30 days.

\
For an example:

* Sneaker release on 25th October
* then You should start taking pre orders on 20th -23rd October.
* you tell us you need ISPs on 23rd right after you close orders and you inform us the total amount customers have ordered. For example lets say 100 in total.
* Then within 24 hours we will get you the 100 ISPs and ping you in the ticket
* then on the 24th of October you deliver all the ISPs to your customers directly via the dashboard.
* Now they are ready for the big release on the 25th October.

this is how most customers do it.

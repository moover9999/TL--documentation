# ‚ùî What can be done if the Stripe account gets suspended?

You have a few options here.

You can get a new account or try to get back your old account. What most people do is create a new Stripe account and give it to us (TL) so that we can update the dashboard in the meantime you can appeal the decision from Stripe by saying you got scammed by fraudulent chargebacks. This way you have 0 downtimes in your business and you can continue selling until you get the main one back. Once you get it back we can switch it again. Further, try to contact a manager on their support team and explain the situation with the fraud.

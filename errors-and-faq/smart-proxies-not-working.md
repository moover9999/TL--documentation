# ‚ùî Smart proxies not working?

There are few reasons that smart proxies might not work

1. Customer might not have data
2. Their order has failed - they haven't received their data
3. They may be out of data - not having enough data
4. They may be testing on googe. Smart proxy does not allow testing on google therefore please ask the customers to test the proxies on a website like Footlocker.

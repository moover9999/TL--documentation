# ‚ùî Will the ISP product be removed from the dashboard after 30 days ?

The order will be still on their dashboard as it provides proof of delivery. What most people do is that they specify in the product description that these expire 30 days from day of purchase. The order it self has the delivery date so customers are usually pretty aware of when the proxies will expire

If you also want to specify further when the proxies will expire for example 7 days 30 days you can use the expiration feature and link our docs page to that feature.

By enabling this and giving the proper dates you can specify when the ISPs expire.

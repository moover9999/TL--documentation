# ‚ùî Why is it indicating Out of Stock ?

For various reasons, the customer dashboard may display an error message indicating that a product is out of stock. There are primarily two reasons for this, as follows:

* The product does not have an active batch.
* The product has an active batch but does not have enough stock left for the selected price amount.

To resolve the above issue, the customer can create a new batch by referring to the following guide.

{% content-ref url="../../data-center-and-accounts/creating-a-batch/" %}
[creating-a-batch](../../data-center-and-accounts/creating-a-batch/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Even after creating the batch, if you encounter an "out of stock" status, please contact the administrative support along with the product name.

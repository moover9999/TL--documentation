# ‚ùî How to change the domain ?

1. First, delete all the old records (i.e. Cname record, Aname record & Alias record related to the previous domain)
2. Add the site to the domain following the guide.

{% content-ref url="../../onboarding-guide/adding-your-site-to-your-domain.md" %}
[adding-your-site-to-your-domain.md](../../onboarding-guide/adding-your-site-to-your-domain.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

3. Follow the guide and Whitelabel the proxies.

{% content-ref url="../../onboarding-guide/white-labeling-proxies-with-your-domain.md" %}
[white-labeling-proxies-with-your-domain.md](../../onboarding-guide/white-labeling-proxies-with-your-domain.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

4. Once everything is updated, send a screenshot of all the DNS settings

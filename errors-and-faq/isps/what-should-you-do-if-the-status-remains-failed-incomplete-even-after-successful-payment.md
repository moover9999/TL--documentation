# ❔ What should you do if the status remains Failed/Incomplete even after successful payment?

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide is designed to assist you in resolving situations where a payment is successfully processed, but due to an issue, the status is not updated and displays as failed or incomplete. In such cases, it's essential to verify if the payment was indeed received and manually attempt to retry the order. This action ensures that the transaction becomes successful and the status gets updated accordingly.

It's important to note that this process is applicable only for ISPs (Internet Service Providers), and the option is accessible solely for transactions within the current month.

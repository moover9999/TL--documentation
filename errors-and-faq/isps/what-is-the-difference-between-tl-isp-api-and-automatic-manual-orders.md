# ‚ùî What is the Difference Between TL ISP API and Automatic/Manual Orders?

**TL ISP API** is an integration provided within our dashboard. It is an automated ISP distribution system that we have developed internally. All ISPs are sourced from trusted providers and are automatically fulfilled through our dashboard, so there is no need for you to supply your own ISPs; we provide everything you need.

**Automatic and Manual Modes** are used if you are supplying your own proxies. In automatic mode, you can copy all your proxies (e.g., 10,000) and paste them into our automatic mode release panel. Once loaded, as orders come in, they will be delivered automatically.

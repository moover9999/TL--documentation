# ‚ùî Why TL ISP API has 28 days billing period whereas 30 days period for proxies?

Please be noted that here the billing period is 28 days whereas the proxy expiration period is 30 days. The reason why we have 2 days gap is to allow the customers to have a 2 days window to renew so that they can have the proxies used without any interruption.

This allows the customers to prepare funds and do the payments smoothly without any troubles because of the 2 days window we have provided.

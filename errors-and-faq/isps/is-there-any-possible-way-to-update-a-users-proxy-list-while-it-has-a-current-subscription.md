# ❔ Is there any possible way to update a user's proxy list while it has a current subscription?

If you are using API (i.e. Porter , MPM , TL ISP , Custom), you can’t do that manually. But If it is a non-API order (Auto , Manual) , then yes, you can update a user's proxy list while it has a current subscription.

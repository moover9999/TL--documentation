# ISP Proxy Grace Period

For our ISP proxies, we've set the billing cycle to every 28 days because the proxies are active for 30 days. This 28-day billing ensures that customers have a two-day grace period before their proxies expire.

In the first month, if a customer cancels their subscription, they still have two additional days to use their proxies because of this grace period.

Over time, this grace period accumulates. For example, if a customer maintains their subscription for 10 months and then decides to cancel, they would have an additional 20 days to use their proxies, thanks to the compounded grace period. Essentially, each month adds two extra days, so after 10 months, the customer has a 20-day grace period.

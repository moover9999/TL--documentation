# ‚ùî How to Request a Replacement, Refund, or Swap for ISPs ?

1. **Submit a Screenshot of the Error:**
   * Make sure the screenshot includes:
     * The token number or proxies.
     * A timestamp, to help us analyze the issue in more detail.
2. **Eligibility for Replacement:**
   * **Timeframe:** If the issue is reported within 36 hours, the customer is entitled to a replacement for non-working proxies. This applies equally if a customer wants to swap the proxies.
   * **Definition of Non-Working Proxies:** These are proxies that are dead or not functioning upon delivery.
   * **Testing Criteria:**
     * We will replace proxies that fail to work on Google or any other basic site.
     * For website-specific proxies (e.g., Ticketmaster proxies), replacements will only be provided if they do not work on the intended site. For retail proxies, replacements will be considered if they do not function on sites such as Nike, Amazon, Best Buy, or Walmart.
   * **Limitations:**
     * We do not guarantee Shopify proxy protection or any of its ranges.
     * We cannot guarantee functionality on very niche sites, but we can provide testers for you to assess them before purchasing.
     * We do not promise any specific fraud score.
3. **Processing Refunds:**
   * If the issue was reported within 36 hours and we have confirmed the problem, proceed with the refund.
   * Refunds can only be processed after verification and confirmation of the issues.

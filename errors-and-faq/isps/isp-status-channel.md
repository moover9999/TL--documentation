# ➗ ISP status channel

{% hint style="info" %}
We have added a discord bot that will mirror the status of the ISP lock and unlock channel to a specified channel.

Currently, the status only reflects the status on Footlocker USA. We will add more websites or statuses as we see fit in the future.
{% endhint %}

1. First, create a webhook for your desired channel that you would like to receive the message - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKksxz2Gdnc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKksxz2Gdnc)
2. Use the following command on the chat and Paste the webhook you created in step 01&#x20;

```
/subscribe
```

add multiple subscriptions using the following command

```
/subscribe {url} {nickname}
```

Also, you can use the following command to see all the subscriptions.

```
/show_subscriptions
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can go up to 5 URLs here
{% endhint %}

3. Press Enter

{% hint style="info" %}
Now the ISP status channel is directly going to this specific webbook that you have created on a specific channel. So for the customers to use this command, they have to use this directly on their client ticket.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to remove it, then you have to do the following command. No need to enter any webhooks.
{% endhint %}

```
/unsubscribe
```

# ‚ùî Can a price be edited instead of archiving and creating a new one?

If you want to change a price, you can edit existing prices for residential products and one-time data center/account products on Stripe. Alternatively, you can archive an existing price and create a new one. Afterward, you can easily resynchronize on the admin dashboard to display the updated prices on the customer dashboard.&#x20;

However, you cannot change or archive a recurring product with an active status, as doing so would affect the subscription renewal.

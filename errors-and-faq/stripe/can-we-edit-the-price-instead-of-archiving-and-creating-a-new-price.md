# ‚ùî Can we edit the price instead of archiving and creating a new price ?

If you wish to change a price, you can edit the existing prices for Residential Products and One-time Datacenter / Account products on Stripe. Then, you can easily resync on the admin dashboard to display the updated prices on the customer dashboard.&#x20;

However, you cannot change or archive a recurring product with an active status, as doing so would affect the renewal of the subscription.

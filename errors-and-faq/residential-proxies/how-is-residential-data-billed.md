# ‚ùî How is residential data billed?

Every GB you allocate to the customer (customer purchase or manual data updates), not data consumption. At the end of each month, you will get an invoice for the data usage.

If you remove data within a billing period (From the 1st day till the last day of the month) this will be accounted for in your invoice. However, if you have already been invoiced and you decide to remove data this change will be accounted for in the next billing period.&#x20;

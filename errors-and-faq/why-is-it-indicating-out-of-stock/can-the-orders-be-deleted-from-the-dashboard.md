# ‚ùî Can the orders be deleted from the dashboard?

Unfortunately, there is no way to delete an order or a transaction from the dashboard. Because transactions are transactional data lines so we cannot delete these. The only time you can delete a transaction is only if it's a manual mode transaction that is incomplete. In that case, you can delete it.

Further, if you want to refund a customer normally just go to Stripe and you can refund it through Stripe.

Please find the following options you have for editing/deleting.

1. Customers cannot delete residential product orders. However, they can edit a user's data balance by going to this guide.

# ðŸŽ“ Proxy Generation

{% hint style="info" %}
This section will guide you regarding the options and functions available on user dashboard when generating proxies.&#x20;

Our dashboard provides customers with a range of options for generating different formats, which is great for flexibility. Additionally, the ability to target proxies by country, state, and city allows customers to optimize the proxy usage for specific geographic locations. This can be particularly useful for businesses that have a strong local presence and need to gather data from specific regions. Overall, these features provide customers with greater control and customization options, which can ultimately lead to more efficient and effective use of proxies.

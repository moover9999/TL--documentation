{% hint style="info" %}
Customers can create a referral link in the customer dashboard to share with others. This is applicable only for the initial purchase by newly joined users. When individuals use this link to register and purchase a residential plan for the first time, the customer will receive credits corresponding to the rate of the chosen plan. These credits can be redeemed for data and are applicable only for the initial purchase by newly joined users. This is a feature flag and admin dash customers can enable or disable it in more settings section, it only works for residential plans for now.

### Setting Product Rates & Redemption Rates

1. Go to other settings and Enter the product rates. The rates you enter here will be the number of credits per GB you allocate when someone uses the referral link and refers to another person.&#x20;
2. Next, you need to enter the redemption rates and that will be the number of credits per GB to be redeemed in purchasing data.



{% hint style="info" %}
The appropriateness of sharing the referral link depends on your intended purpose and the sales strategy you are employing.

For instance, setting a high product rate and a low redemption rate may incentivize people to share the link more frequently. This is because they can earn more credits, allowing them to redeem a greater amount of GBs. When establishing these rates, consider factors such as:

Factors to consider in determining product/redemption rates

* Average initial data purchase&#x20;
* Average sales&#x20;
* Ability to share the referral link&#x20;
* Encouraging the sales of a particular product&#x20;
* Target audience
* Seasonal trends
* Referral program goal (Increasing sales, promotion, expanding customer base, etc.)

You can adjust the rates according to your specific purpose and goals.

### Initial Purchase

1. Initial purchases can be made by using the generated referral link sent by another user. Once the received link is clicked, it will automatically be directed to the particular user dashboard. The initial purchase that the user is going to make, would add a certain amount of credits depending on the product rates entered under the _Other Settings_.

> Refer to the following scenario for further understanding.
>
>
>
> A - Referral link generator&#x20;
>
> B - The individual making the initial purchase using the shared referral link&#x20;
>
> Product rate for Packetstream - 10 credits per GB
>
> If "A" generates the link and shares it with "B", and then "B" purchases 1GB of Packetstream using the referral link, this purchase adds 10 credits under "A". According to the number of credits per GB entered under redemption rates would decide how many credits need to be earned so that "A" can use these credits to buy any residential product if they meet the required credit threshold for purchasing residential products. This policy is applicable only for the initial purchase.
>
> In this scenario, if "B" generates another referral link for themselves and shares it with a person named "C," then the initial purchase made by "C" will bring credits for "B"

4. Click on the _Claim_ button to claim the data.

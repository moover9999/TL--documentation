# üèß Customer subscription portal

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide will help you set up subscription management within stripe and will help you customize the functionality of the customer portal.
{% endhint %}

Our customer-facing dashboard has a new settings page where customers can now see their Stripe billing portal.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="access-user-settings.md" %}
[access-user-settings.md](access-user-settings.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

This is only visible if the customer has bought a recurring product. In the Stripe billing portal, they can cancel their subscription or update their billing details along with many other settings.

In Stripe, you can customize the billing portal so you can enable or disable the ability for a customer to cancel their recurring product by themself. You can also add an option to pause and unpause the billing as well. Below you can see all the available settings you can customize to your liking.

To manage the billing settings you can do it through the following link: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal)

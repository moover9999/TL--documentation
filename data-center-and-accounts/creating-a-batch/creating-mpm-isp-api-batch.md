If you precisely registered, all the APIs would appear under the dropdown list including _MPM Proxies_. ISP API batch types for all the customers are now shown as MPM Proxies. Accordingly, choose the relevant option when creating the new batch.

At this stage, it gives the ability to assign one product/batch and deliver the stock in one batch.

4\. Now you can add a stock limit and duration for expiration. Then tick confirm and select launch. At this point, the combination of the batch has to be equal to or more than the stock limit.

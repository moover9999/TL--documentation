# âš“ Creating a Torch Labs PAYG ISP API batch

1. First, you need to [creating-a-recurring-price-for-a-product.md](../../product-settings/creating-a-recurring-price-for-a-product.md "mention")and set a custom recurring period to 28 days instead of a month

{% hint style="info" %}
you need to make sure, the price you have created has a custom recurring period set to 28 days. We do this because, if the customers' payment method fails, they now have a grace period of 2 days to complete the payment in order to keep the same set of proxies/items.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Depending on the product you can add any **Quantity between 1 to 200.**

* US product: VEVE , TICK , RETL , JUIC , DAILY
* EU product: DTAG , VIRM , COLT , DAILY
* AU product: VOCU , DAILY
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Quantity - 254**

(Subnets)

* US product: RETL\_24 , JUIC\_24 , DC\_24
* EU product: DTAG\_24
* AU product: VOCU\_24
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Daily products only last for 24 hours, so they're meant to be one-time products. This means you can't set up recurring prices for them. Further, these are not extendable or renewable.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please remember this when adding the `amount` metadata field inside the Stripe price. [product-metadata.md](../../product-settings/product-metadata.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

2. Next, you must go to the products section and sync your new prices.

{% content-ref url="../adding-data-center-products.md" %}
[adding-data-center-products.md](../adding-data-center-products.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

3. Go to the _Datacenter_ tab on Admin Dashboard.

6\. Now you can add a stock limit, tick confirm, and select launch.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the expiration is hardcoded for 30 days by default and this cannot be changed. This means your customers will be able to use their proxies for 30 days.
{% endhint %}

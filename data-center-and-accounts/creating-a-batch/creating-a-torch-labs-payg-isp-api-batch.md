# âš“ Creating a Torch Labs PAYG ISP API batch

1. First, you need to [creating-a-recurring-price-for-a-product.md](../../product-settings/creating-a-recurring-price-for-a-product.md "mention")and set a custom recurring period to 28 days instead of a month

{% hint style="info" %}
you need to make sure, the price you have created has a custom recurring period set to 28 days. We do this because, if the customers' payment method fails, they now have a grace period of 2 days to complete the payment in order to keep the same set of proxies/items.

The next field is where we capture if you are making a daily/weekly/monthly product. Therefore, we use the following identifiers. (Each product can have only one Identifier, so if you want to make weekly and monthly DC plans, you will need to make two individual products)

<mark style="color:red;">`torchlabs_accounts`</mark>
